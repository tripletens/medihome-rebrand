        <p class="text-blue-800 text-lg">MHCS Medicare was the second team for my late father. They cooperated with me. They understood his issues,
          they totally supported him and me right up to the end. I will forever feel grateful.
          You helped me keep him where he wanted to be, and you know how to play along with him always.
          Kudos!! The contract then started around February 2018, until he sadly passed away in May 2021 at age of 87yrs.
          I can honestly say they became like family to us and still are. Their standard of care is amazing but more than that they really do put patient first. I salute the MD & His team for professionalism indeed!!</p>

        <p class="text-blue-800 text-lg">I am happy to depend on their care and assistance. Interestingly, the team leader is always in contact, checking the Patient & Carers as well. They are mega home care professionals & Specialist indeed. I have already recommended this company to my friends both home and abroad. What a special team. Thank you all at MEDIHOME!!</p>

        <p class="text-blue-800 text-lg">MediHome care services visited my father daily (and more by request of a phone call as necessary).
          They are all very nice, skilled and cheerful people, who really care.
          They also take time to connect other Specialist when the need arise and have a conversation that promotes the wellbeing of their patients.
          I sincerely recommend them.</p>

          I cannot recommend them highly enough; something we couldn't always do with previous caring team. Effortless triumph!!</p>

        <p class="text-blue-800 text-lg">My mother has been through some care companies - six or seven of them - and I can say without any hesitation that MediHome care Services is the best care company we could have wished for. The carers from MEDIHOME are second to none. All my siblings, we never worry about Mama's challenge since we engaged MediHome. Though she's not an easy old woman but they won her heart. Kudos to you all!!</p>
